At the moment I think I want these distinct sockets:

  - The local UDP input socket (bound to IPV4 loopback, unicast).  This is
    where the local sources will connect.  This is unencrypted.
  - The multicast output socket.  This will receive log messages from remote
    sources (encrypted with XChaCha20-Poly1305 with 192 bit nonce).
  - A unicast UDP socket to handle requests for the multicast encryption
    key we're using.  Note these keys are unique to each multicaster.
    This socket is bidirectional and encrypted with XChaCha20-Poly1305
    with 192 bit nonce.
  - What do I want to do about multicast input?

Message selection:

  - hostname, appname, facility, severity
