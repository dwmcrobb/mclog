I need a routing configuration so I can specify whether or not
to forward:

- local messages (received on loopback) to files
  - local messages (received on loopback) to multicast
  - multicast messages (sent to group from others) to files

I need a filtering config that allows message selection, so
I can configure file output and also what gets sent via the
aforementioned routing.  Message selection:

  - source host
  - facility
  - minimum priority
  - ident
