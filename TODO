I need configuration knobs for log files:
  - rollover period
  - number of rollover files to keep
  - permissions

I then need the code to use the new knobs.

Add validation of messages on loopback interface?
  - header.origin.hostname should be local hostname (or just overwrite
    it?)
  - Check processid?  Unfortunately this would involve a system call,
    for example kill(pid,0, and is probably not something I want to do
    for every message.
